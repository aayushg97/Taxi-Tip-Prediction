# Taxi-Tip-Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims at creating a model that can predict how much a taxi driver is tipped for a taxi trip, using NYC-TLC Taxi Trip data set.

## Dataset

The New York City - Taxi and Limousine Commission trip records can be found at in the [data and reports](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) section on their website. In this project, the Yellow taxi trip records for the year 2022 were used to train the model.
